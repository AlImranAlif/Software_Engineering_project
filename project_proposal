1.	PROJECT PROPOSAL: Inquiro 
1.1 Background to the Problem
In schools, colleges, and universities, students often struggle with doubts while studying. Sometimes they’re too shy to ask teachers, or the teacher isn't available. Many try to search online but fail to find clear or reliable answers that match their curriculum or context. Social media groups and chats get messy, full of unrelated content, and lack quality control.
The root of this problem lies in the lack of an organized, student-friendly platform where academic doubts can be solved easily by peers and educators. Unlike general platforms like Quora or Stack Overflow that focus on broader audiences (coding or general questions), students need a dedicated space tailored to their academic level and environment.
This is an important issue because unresolved doubts can build gaps in learning, increase stress, reduce motivation, and affect academic performance. With proper support, students can learn faster, better, and with more confidence.
1.2 Solution to the Problem
Project Objective
Our project, Inquiro, aims to create a web-based platform for peer-to-peer learning and doubt solving. The goal is to connect students with their peers and mentors in a more organized and supportive environment.
Proposed Solution
Inquiro will allow students to:
•	Post academic questions with text, images or both.
•	Receive answers from other students, peer tutors or teachers.
•	Respond using rich media like text, images, videos or YouTube links.
•	Upvote or downvote answers so that the best responses surface to the top.
•	Earn points, rank and appear on leaderboards to motivate users and highlight top contributors.
•	Join subject-wise or class-wise forums to keep discussions organized and focused.
•	Schedule consulting sessions with peer tutors for more in-depth help.
•	Post and view event notices about academic events or competitions.
•	Be part of a moderated community with rules, admin control and user management features (like banning rule violators).
This solution is appropriate because it directly addresses the communication and learning gaps students face. It promotes collaborative learning, uses gamification to encourage participation and maintains quality and safety through moderation. 
The solution is technically feasible and aligns with current web development capabilities. Tools like modern frameworks (e.g., React, Node.js) and cloud platforms make building such a platform scalable and efficient.
Key Functionalities 
•	Rich question and answer interface supporting text, images, and video.
•	Gamification mechanics (points, ranking, leaderboard).
•	Forum structure for clean subject-wise discussion.
•	Rule-based moderation tools for content safety.
•	Real-time consulting session booking system.
•	Event noticeboard for student engagement beyond Q&A.
These features make use of current web technologies and social platforms design best practices to create an impactful educational tool. The platform also contributes to digital well-being by focusing on educational content and cutting down online distraction.
Target Users & Benefits
Target Users:
•	University students
•	College students 
•	Peer tutors and educators
Benefits:
•	Get academic doubts resolved quickly and reliably.
•	Connect with peers and seniors for real learning support.
•	Stay motivated through ranking and achievements.
•	Join study-specific groups for organized help.
•	Access extra support through tutor consulting.
•	Discover academic events and competitions easily.
Scientific and Social Contribution
Inquiro promotes collaborative learning, digital inclusion and knowledge-sharing culture. It supports active learning, which research shows is more effective than passive methods. The platform documents learning patterns, engagement metrics and can serve as a dataset for educational research in peer learning systems.
Literature Review
Several studies have explored the role of peer learning and Q&A forums in education:
•	Stack Overflow has shown how technical Q&A can help in skill-building, but it is programming-centric and not student-focused.
•	Quora is general-purpose and lacks academic structuring.
•	Piazza is used in some universities for academic Q&A, but it’s mostly professor-controlled and not peer-driven.
•	Reddit-style forums have shown the power of community answers but are often unmoderated and unfocused.
Inquiro learns from these models but extends their ideas with:
•	Academic structuring based on subjects and class levels.
•	Strong focus on peer learning (students helping students).
•	Built-in gamification for continuous engagement.
•	Moderation tools to maintain quality and safe interaction.
•	Additional features like consulting sessions and event boards that current solutions lack.
Existing Software Solutions
Some platforms that partially solve parts of this problem:
•	Stack Overflow: Great for developers, lacks support for general student academic queries.
•	Quora: Broad and general, no academic filtering or control.
•	Piazza: Class-based Q&A, but limited access and interaction beyond enrolled courses.
•	Facebook/WhatsApp groups: Too informal, unorganized and hard to moderate.
How Inquiro Improves on Them
•	Focused only on students and educators.
•	Well-structured by class and subject.
•	Built-in motivational features (gamification).
•	Offers direct help from peer tutors through consulting.
•	Has a safe and moderated environment.
•	Includes event promotion features, helping students stay informed.
In summary, Inquiro is a student-centered learning platform designed to solve a real academic problem by making it easier, safer, and more motivating for students to help each other. It combines the best features of modern forums, social networks, and educational tools into one simple and useful solution.
